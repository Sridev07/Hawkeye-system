TO RUN THIS SYSTEM:
Requirements
   1)PYTHON 3.10 ABOVE
   2)DOWNLOAD NECESSARY LIBRARIES
train the model using extract_features.py "possample path" and "negpath" it will be saved to posfeat and negfeat.
1)run balltracking.py with arguments( "video path"),attack(fast,spin).
it will track the ball and batsman height and the coordinates will be saved to coordinates.txt.
2) run 3d.py to visualize the results(ball trajectory will be shown)
record the results thus hawkeye system is made.


Additionally for yolov9 :
use run notebook.ipynb one for detection and one for tracking
